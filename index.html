        <h3>Map</h3>
        <p>I was born in Hsinchu Zhubei City. I grown up in Hsinchu all my lifetime until now studying at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University(NYCU). I graduate at Kornell Academy for my elementary school. It is a bilingual school near the HSR station. 
        I then go to Shu Guang junior high school. After graduate junior high, I enter Hsinchu Hight School. I am now in the department of information management and finanace (IMF). </p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>Of course my favorite food is a lot of meat as you can see in the picture. Few pieces of meat can't satisfy me and only a bunch of meat will make me happy!
        But beside meat, desserts also are in my favor. Tiramisu, pudding, makaron, bubble milk tea are the ones I prefer most! Not only am I a meat fanatic, I am also crazy in desserts!</p>

        <h3>Smiles</h3>
        <p>The most important thing that can make me smile is when I see an A+ on my statistic (II)! Beside it, since college life is sometime stressful and tired, sleeping can also 
        make me in a good mood. I like to play basketball, it is a relax to me. I am dreaming about that someday I am able to dunk. I will have a huge huge smile is the dream comes true.
        Listening to music can also make me smile as it can help me relax during walking or exercising. Another thing that I will be happy is going on a vacation. The picture is in Japan with my few 
        college friends during winter vacation in 2025.</p>
